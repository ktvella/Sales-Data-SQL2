# Sales-Data-SQL2

An SQL-based analytics solution to empower e-commerce decision-makers with actionable insights. By integrating and querying key tables, I created reports on regional revenue, top-selling products, monthly sales trends, and individual customer lifetime value. This project enables businesses to pinpoint growth opportunities, optimize inventory and pricing strategies, and tailor marketing efforts for maximum ROI.
